Task #2
âœ… Leap Year Checker:
Create a program that determines whether a given year is a leap year.
A leap year is divisible by 4, but not by 100 unless it is also divisible by 400.
Use an if-else statement to make this determination.
Input = 2024
Output = Leap year

input_year = 2024

    Output = "Leap Year"
else:
    Output = "Not a Leap Year"

print(Output)
